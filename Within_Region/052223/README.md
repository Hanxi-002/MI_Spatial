# Within\_Region\_ER\_052223

## Background / Motivation
Assign regions to 2 categories "close to resting fibroblast" and "closet to active fibroblast" by looking at the porportion of resting vs fibro in each region. Then run the analyses within HF and within Control to compare the LFs found by ER and SLIDE. <br>

Note that within each region, each cell type has a dcc file. So only used the CD68 dcc files.
