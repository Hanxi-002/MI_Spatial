# Within\_Region\_ER\_052423hf

## Background / Motivation
Based on the [052223_hf](https://github.com/Hanxi-002/MI_Spatial/tree/main/Within_Region/052223_hf) experiment where the prediction power is low. <br>
That experiment only had pipeline3. This experiment uses the same data but running the entire pipeline for parameter optimization.

## Notes
* Pipeline1 didn't finish despite of running for 7 days. Taking the best delta from step 1.1 and run pipeline 3.
