# AR_RF concatenated

### LINKS
[Script to produce HF Annotaiton file including Y Label]{}

### Notes
This analysis is for the HF regions where each region has AR and RF expressions. Therefore, each gene will appear twice. 
Because of the high dimensionality, we pick the highest variant features within the X. Without looking at Y. 

A separate annotation file is produced called "HF_Final_Annotation_RFAF_Ratio.csv". This file includes the RFAF label column at the end. 
**Importantly**, note that 2 DCCs were deleted becuase the data looked starnge. "DSP-1001660011816-D-B11" and "DSP-1001660012268-C-H09".
