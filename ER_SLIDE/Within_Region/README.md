# Within Region

These anlyses focuses on subsetting cell type from each ROI. Each ROI is consisted of 3 AOI, one for each cell type. 

**Analysis 1: CD68 Comparison** <br>
Study the CD68 specific differences in regions that are close or futhur away from active fibroblast rich spatial regions. Y is binary (close to far away) decided by normalized nucleus number for RF and AF. <br>

**Analysis 1: RF+AF Comparison** <br>
Same label as Anlysis group 1, but study the differences of RF and AF. More specifically, column stack the gene expression of RF and AF for each region. No CD68 specific expression is used. <br>
