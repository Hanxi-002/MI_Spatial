# cross\_prediction\AF\_RF\_082123

## Background / Motivation
* Cross prediction of using latent factors from AF (Y as close/far away from AF) than run linear regression on RF.
* Used GetAFY.py to get the y vector, where each sample is a AF ROI and the classes determine if it is further away or close to active fibroblasts.
