# Within\_Region\_ER\_121223

## Background / Motivation
Assign regions to 2 categories "close to resting fibroblast" and "closet to active fibroblast" by looking at the porportion of resting vs fibro in each region.<br>
This analysis only includes the HF regions and CD68 AOI. <br>

Copied x an y from 0524hf. <br>
The get_data.R in this folder output an x that is NOT being used. Because 2 samples were deleted in the python step.
But sticking to the original pre-processing steps.

This is a repeated analysis intend to get the clean results and clan box plots to put into the manuscripts.
