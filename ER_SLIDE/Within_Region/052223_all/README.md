# Within\_Region\_ER\_052223

## Background / Motivation
Assign regions to 2 categories "close to resting fibroblast" and "closet to active fibroblast" by looking at the porportion of resting vs fibro in each region. <br>
This analysis is ran on all regions including both HF and control. 

Note that within each region, each cell type has a dcc file. So only used the CD68 dcc files. 

Only pipeline3 is ran for this experiment.

## Notes

* The violin plot shows very little difference. Need to run the entire pipeline and check if better delta and lambda will help with the prediction power.
