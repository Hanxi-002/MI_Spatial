# Within\_Region\_ER\_060723hf

## Notes
1. In all previous analyses, we have treated each AOI (each cell type) as a sample. Here, we performa column joint on the features for each cell type. For example, for geneA, we will have geneA\_RF and geneA\_AF 2 features. 
2. Only within HF samples and only for RF and AF cell types.
