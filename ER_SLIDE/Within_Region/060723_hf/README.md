# 060723\_hf

## Background / Motivation
Only within HF samples. Take the AOI of RF and AF from each ROI. The Y label is still decided by the normalized ratio of RF and AF. Column stack the gene expression in RF and AF.

Y\_w\_ROI.csv is the Y file that contains the slide labels and ROI. Previous CD68 experiments used DCC file name as Y row names. But DCC file names are no longer valid because thoes are specific to the CD68 AOIs. So we added Slide name and ROI labels to help identify which ROI the Y is for. The final y.csv will not contain 4 columns.
