# Within\_Region\_ER\_052223

## Background / Motivation
Assign regions to 2 categories "close to resting fibroblast" and "closet to active fibroblast" by looking at the porportion of resting vs fibro in each region. <br>
This anlyses only includes control regions

Note that within each region, each cell type has a dcc file. So only used the CD68 dcc files.
